#HTML Crash Course
> made by Donovan Adrian in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## ***Welcome...***
...to your new HTML Crash Course! I hope that this can be 
used for beginners in finding their way around the weird
world of programming. In this particular case, HTML, 
JavaScript, and CSS exclusively to keep things simple. Each
of these programming languages all come together to be 
able to achieve monumental tasks across the world wide web... 
Sometimes in better ways than others. I hope that through the 
following "lesson plan", I can teach you how to become a 
decent programmer, to develop a keen eye for details, and 
perhaps delve into some ways to keep things efficient as well. 
But first! A quick tutorial!

## ***How On EARTH Do I Interpret All This???***
...You may be asking me. To be honest, I still have 
trouble from time to time, don't get yourself down. 
Depending on the layout of GitHub, you should see a 
list of all the directories (folders) and files included 
in this GitHub Repository. To continue moving forward in 
each lesson, use the filepath that's included below
(/directory/directory/file.extension). 
I have also included simple descriptions under each lesson 
to try and give a relative summary of what to expect in each 
section.

## ***You Idiot! This Is An Awful Crash Course!***
...Okay? I'm not a doctor or anything, cut me a little 
slack pls. I'm creating this to help teach a close 
friend some programming skills and hopefully other 
people can find this helpful too.
