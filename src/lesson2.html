Now that you know the basics, I'm gonna jump right into the file!

And now we see something called a "div" tag! This is something that we can use to designate specific sections
in our HTML file. Depending on how we want our webpage laid out, we can have as many or as few div tags as we
want! In this case, we're just using one div tag to envelope all of our page content and center it.

Take particular note in the "class" attribute... You'll see more examples of this within the file. This is what
links us to the CSS file, where we have a "webContent" field where we specify centered text and such!
-->
<div class="webContent">
  <p>Of course, you'll notice here that we have two different buttons that you can click! Feel free to
  click on either one to get a feel for how they act and react based upon the simple code that is in the
  JavaScript file.</p>
  <!--
  Notice that you can designate attributes to each element. This one was given a specific "ID" that can be
  referred to within other files on the webpage. In this case, the JavaScript file.
  -->
  <button id="btn">Click Me!</button>
  <br><br>
  <!--
  You can also designate specific functions to elements which trigger functions in the JavaScript file.
  Here we see that clicking on this fancy "button" (of course, it's a span element, but you get the idea!)
  will trigger the "exampleFunction3". You can also use the parenthesis here to pass specific text, numbers,
  etc into the function. For example, exampleFunction3("Hello World").
  -->
  <span class="webButton" onclick="exampleFunction3()">Click Me Too!</span>
</div>
