***Introduction***
Now that you've been acquainted with the bare bones and an example perspective for
programming, let's get on with the next lesson! We're going to look at a couple new
things now... In particular, how the different languages communicate with each other!
You may have noticed in the last lesson how the HTML file "links" to the CSS and JS
files, as seen in the next two lines pulled directly from the HTML file.

<script src="js/lesson1.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link href="css/lesson1.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>

But of course, what good are these links if you don't do anything with them? There
are MANY wonderful ways that all the languages communicate with each other to build
the user experience. Let's continue on to the HTML file to see what's in store!



***HTML***
Wow! What a cool animation (if you opened it in a browser)! Otherwise, it's just
simple text in this file, but it's really so much more. While HTML itself can
be powerful and rich in functionality, the JavaScript and CSS that you implement
can really start to bring the webpage to life! In this particular case, the HTML
truly is the backbone of the webpage, where the idea of a recipe made by a chef
really starts to shine. Feel free to click some of the buttons that are in this
page to see how they react. Otherwise, take a look at the HTML file itself to see
what's really going on behind the scenes!



***JavaScript***
Well, well, well... We meet some of my dreaded nemesis's... null values! Rather,
there are two that are here, but one is hidden... One is the "nullExample", which
is initialized to null, of course. The second is "btn", which is technically
undefined, until you give it purpose! If you were to try to use this variable before
initializing it, things could break, which obviously is no good.

From there, we will dive a little deeper into some of the ways that you can use JS
to give the webpage some functionality. Be sure to take a look at the console as
you play around, too!



***CSS***
And now we finally get our first look at some styles! Here you can see some examples
of how to change the background color, text color, and give some of the HTML elements
some room to breathe! We even have a simple animation of some text fading into view.
We'll be sure to revisit some animations in the next two lessons as well, don't worry!

Of course, feel free to play around with some of the numbers and letters that appear in
this file. After you edit one, refresh the page to see your changes take effect!
Additionally, some browsers (Chrome, for example) will allow you to completely change
how the webpage looks in real time.



***Conclusion***
Now that we've gotten to really dip our toes into some more uses for these languages,
I'm gonna really start to show you some more "practical" uses for a webpage. In
particular, data processing! Can you imagine all the work that your browser is doing
in the background to give you a quick look at the world of the internet? Well, I can
show you a few examples... In the next lesson!
