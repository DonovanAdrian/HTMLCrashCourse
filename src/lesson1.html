<!--This is how you comment in HTML! Comments can be used to add fancy notes to your files-->

Comments can also span multiple paragraphs,
so you can add all sorts of important information
in a really convenient manner

    the page itself. As such, it tells the browser all sorts of important information...

        Without getting too complex, this tag tells the browser what kind of letters to use

        Notice that when you open this file in a browser,
        there isn't a huge gap between the text and the button
        here. That's because you'll need to "tell" the browser
        specifically where to place certain "breaks" in text.
        An example of this can be seen below with the <br> tag.
